# Universal ReactJS boilerplate

## Exercises:

1. Fix the script `start` so we can execute `npm start` from the terminal. Hint, which file is the entry point?  

2. Change server/app.jsx so it renders the React components

3. Change server/app.jsx so it sends the JavaScript bundle to the client. Hint, Webpack is not creating a file on the disk so don't search for a bundle.js file in your disk. Webpack is generating and serving the file from memory (so it's faster).

4. Add a new route called 'photos' that mapps the Photos component

5. Implement the fetch function in Photos component

6. Implement the componentDidMount function in Photos component
